## About Day 1

I read about the basic components(View, Text, Image, TextInput, ScrollView, and StyleSheet) in React Native from their official documentation and how these components are used to create views for screens on both iOS and Android devices.

I later designed a UI of a mobile login screen in figma and implemented the design in code using React Native.
